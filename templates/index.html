<h2>History of Vedic Mathematics</h2>

Vedic mathematics is an ancient Indian system of mathematics that is believed to have been developed by the ancient Indian sage Bharata Muni. Bharata Muni is said to have received the knowledge of Vedic mathematics from the god Ganesha.

Vedic mathematics was originally used by the ancient Indians for a variety of purposes, including astronomy, astrology, and architecture. It was also used by the ancient Indians to solve complex mathematical problems.

Vedic mathematics was rediscovered in the early 20th century by the Indian mathematician Sri Bharati Krishna Tirthaji. Tirthaji wrote a book about Vedic mathematics, which helped to popularize the system in India and around the world.

Today, Vedic mathematics is used by people all over the world for a variety of purposes, including education, business, and research.
